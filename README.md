# SharedMediaStreamer
 Currently a proof of concept for learning video streaming consisting of an API and a website.
 Plans are to have an API that can read a video file and a website that calls on the API to get the video data streamed.
 
  # C# ASP.Net MVC API
 The API is written in C#. I have introduced the project to SOLID programming principles as well as carefully thought out architecuture.
 It features clean written code that can easily be maintained. The API should have access to the video file and will be reading a set
 amount of bytes and returning it to the consumer.
